This project is an interactive web application that allows readers to change the atmosphere of a setting according to their mood. Users can seamlessly switch between different scenarios (Normal, Horror, Romantic) using keyboard keys.

To run the project on your computer, follow these steps:

Download the folder or ZIP file containing the project files to your computer.

Make sure the index.html file and the video files (1.mp4, 2.mp4, 3.mp4) are in the same location within the folder.

Open the index.html file in your browser by double-clicking it or dragging the file onto Google Chrome/Safari.

Start the experience by clicking the "Start" button that appears on the screen and switch between atmospheres using the 1-2-3 keys on the keyboard.
